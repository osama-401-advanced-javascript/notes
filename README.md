# notes
## cli app

## class-01

**the idea from this lab is to create a cli app and add notes to it**

*this app is created based on the refactring model, so the index.js fils is the main file that recive the exported data from other files*

*a constructor and two prototype functions are used to check for the command and the data that inserted by the user*

*another constructor and two prototype functions are used to accept the data and print it out as required*
